A to-do list is a simple but powerful tool for organizing tasks and managing your daily activities. It provides a structured way to jot down tasks, prioritize them, and track their completion status. Whether you're tackling work projects, household chores, or personal goals, a to-do list helps you stay focused and productive.

Key features of a to-do list typically include:

Task Entry: Users can easily add new tasks to the list by typing them into an input field and pressing a button.

Task Display: The list displays all tasks in a clear and organized manner, making it easy to see what needs to be done.

Task Management: Users can mark tasks as completed, edit task details, or delete tasks as needed.
